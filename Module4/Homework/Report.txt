   Approx. 8 hours

   This exercise was very good, there were not specification or missing checks that I could see.

6. What parts of your code could use improvement or disappointed you (what work didnâ€™t you get done, that more time would have enabled you to finish, or what bugs did you not resolve)?
   I believe I have done the very best I could do with my abilities at this point.
